# 什么是go-stash
> go-stash is a high performance, free and open source server-side data processing pipeline that ingests data from Kafka, processes it, and then sends it to ElasticSearch.

> go-stash is about 5x throughput more than logstash, and easy to deploy, only one executable file.
>
一个根据某种规则总kafka中过滤数据到ES中的工具。
